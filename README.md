# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
I ran an lm test in R to look at predictibilty of mpg for Mecha Cars. 

``` lm(mpg~vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + ground_clearance + ADW)```

H0: Slope of the linear model is 0 and there is no correlation betweeen MPG and vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance and ADW. 
Ha: Slope of the linear model is not 0 and there is a correlation between MPG and the other varaibles.
